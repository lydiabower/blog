## Remortgaging when your initial rate ends

When you first take out your mortgage, the lender will usually agree an initial rate that usually lasts between two and five years.

When you reach the end of your initial rate, most lenders will automatically switch you onto their Standard Variable Rate (SVR), which tends to be higher than both your initial rate and other competitive deals currently available on the market.

For example, a lender may offer you a fixed rate of 1% for the first two years of your mortgage, and then move you to a Standard Variable Rate of 4% for the remaining term. The SVR will depend on the lender, but it’s often set at a few percentage points above the Bank of England’s base rate, so it can go up and down.

Trussle mortgage adviser Ryan Tuff says: _“Since initial rates will almost certainly be a lot more competitive than the lender’s Standard Variable Rate, most borrowers can save by remortgaging once their initial period has ended. Switching from a lender’s SVR of 4.49% to an initial rate of 1.99% for example, could save the average homeowner £230 per month.”_

Think about switching your mortgage around three months before your initial period ends, as this will give you more time to find an attractive rate as mortgage offers are valid for several months. Bear in mind that it can take up to two weeks to receive an offer from a mortgage lender. If you don’t remortgage before your initial rate finishes, you’re likely to end up on the SVR (but you can still remortgage later on to switch to a better rate).

In some situations, remortgaging when your initial term ends may not make sense. For example, if you’re within several months of paying off your mortgage, the cost of remortgaging may not be balanced out by the amount you’ll save on interest.

## Remortgaging before your initial rate ends

You can choose to remortgage before your initial rate ends, but your mortgage lender will usually penalise you for doing this with an ‘Early Repayment Charge’ (ERC). This is usually charged as a percentage of the loan – for example, 3% of the outstanding loan – which means it can cost you thousands. You’ll need to balance this charge and any other costs of remortgaging against the benefits you hope to gain.

Here are some of the reasons you may want to remortgage before the end of your initial mortgage term:

- to borrow extra money (perhaps to pay off other debts or for home improvement)
- to move to a more flexible mortgage (because you want to make overpayments, for example)
- to get a better rate or a longer (or shorter) term
- to switch from a variable rate to a fixed rate, or from an interest-only to a repayment mortgage

If you’re remortgaging because you want to borrow more money using the equity in your home, bear in mind that although the interest rate may be lower than other types of borrowing (unsecured loans and credit cards, for example), the longer mortgage term will often mean that you pay far more over the lifetime of the loan. It may be more sensible to find other ways of managing your non-mortgage debt.

## Bonus: Remortgaging tips

When you’re looking at remortgaging, take into account any lender or product fees in addition to the interest rate to ensure you’re getting a good deal.

Consider product features when you’re making a decision: will your new mortgage allow you to make overpayments that can reduce the amount you’ll repay over the remaining term of your mortgage, for example?

You could also choose a shorter mortgage term when you remortgage if you want to pay your mortgage off sooner. Be careful, as this will result in increased monthly repayments.

Remember to take into account the cost of a property valuation and solicitor fees when you’re making your remortgaging decision, as these can add up.
