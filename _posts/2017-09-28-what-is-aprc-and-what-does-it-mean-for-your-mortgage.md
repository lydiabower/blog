## What is APRC?
APRC stands for the Annual Percentage Rate of Change. 

You’ll see the APRC alongside the initial rate on all mortgage deals. The initial rate only reflects the rate you’ll pay for that term of your mortgage, while the APRC shows the average interest rate calculated over the entire mortgage term - including your initial rate but also the lender’s SVR you’ll be moved onto once your initial rate has come to an end.

## Why do mortgage deals show the APRC?
The [Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD)](https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/mortgage-credit-directive "MCD"), whose job it is to protect consumers when it comes to mortgages, made it compulsory for lenders to show the APRC on all mortgage deals in March 2016. 


## Is looking at the APRC important when choosing a mortgage?
APRC shows the rate you’ll pay for your mortgage over the entire term including fees, so it sounds like it should be useful. In reality, this isn’t the case, as the APRC covers the whole mortgage term - both your initial rate and the SVR. It’s unlikely you’d stick with the same deal for your entire mortgage lifetime, as once your initial period is over, you’ll be moved onto your lender’s expensive SVR, paying more than you need to. It’s almost always a good idea to remortgage before you reach this point.  

The most important thing to look at when deciding on a mortgage deal is the [true cost](https://trussle.com/blog/understanding-the-true-cost-of-a-mortgage "true cost") - the rate of the initial term, and the fees that come with it. The initial rate will tell you how much you’ll be paying for the first few years of your mortgage deal, after which you’ll switch to a more competitive deal.
