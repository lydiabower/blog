Fresh out of uni (and by fresh, we mean starting work a week after finishing!), Miranda joins Trussle as a member of our Customer Success team, working to give everyone who uses Trussle the best possible experience. Miranda might be the youngest person at Trussle, but she’s probably the most cultured - no one else in the office knows the London gallery scene as well as she does. 

## What were you doing before joining Trussle?
I was working part-time at another tech company in customer success, and going to uni the rest of the time. I finished uni on a Friday and started here the next Monday, so it’s been a bit of a shock to the system, although in a good way… I’m just really tired!  

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I didn’t know anything about mortgages but I’d always heard getting one was such a struggle! When I found out about Trussle I thought it would be a great place to work - I love learning new things, and knowing how mortgages work is really valuable. So far, working here’s been fun, plus we offer people a genuinely helpful service which makes work all the more enjoyable. 

## What is it about customer success that you enjoy the most?
I find conversation very natural - talking to lots of different people is something I enjoy. I think if I was doing something manual I’d get bored quite quickly, but I love the fact my job is about having conversations. Helping people through a big life milestone is also rewarding, and I like knowing they’re getting the best service possible. 

## What did you study at uni?
I was at Goldsmiths in London studying Education, Culture and Society. Basically that involved learning about the history of education, the education system, theories of learning, and arts more generally. Most people go on to do a PGCE or social work, but I bucked the trend and entered the world of mortgages!

## Favourite music?
I’m a big fan of the Arctic Monkeys, The Smiths, Pulp and people like that, but I also embarrassingly have a Blink 182 tattoo - they’re my guilty pleasure. I’ve only got brothers so growing up all we ever listened to was Blink 182 and Eminem. 

## Best thing about working at a startup?
The culture’s great. It’s very casual but everyone works really hard. The environment’s not at all stressy or formal which makes working relaxed and fun. I really appreciate that - it makes it feel worth coming to work when you know you’re going to have a good day. 

## Where could we find you at weekends?
When I was at uni I did a lot of photography, and I love all things arty. Most of my weekends are spent going to gigs, galleries and exhibitions. You can also find me in the pub quite regularly. 

## Favourite gallery in London?
White cube gallery in Bermondsey. It’s very small but has some really cool exhibitions that change quite regularly, plus it’s on a really fun street with lots of restaurants and pubs.

## What was your dream job when you were little?
I really wanted to be a pop star. Secretly I’d still love to have a one hit wonder - no one ever remembers or recognizes you but they know your song. Ideal!
