  Despite the myths, there’s no set rule for the amount you can borrow for your
  mortgage - it depends on a number of factors, just one of which is your
  salary.

## Job Title: Head of Business Operations

_Pippa looks after the internal running of the business, and it’s a big role - managing everything to do with finance, HR, legal, and compliance. Now that we’re a team of over 50, Pippa has her work cut out! But with a background in law, we know she’s up to the job._

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I had a terrible personal experience getting a mortgage myself and thought there must be a better way of doing this! Now I know there is, and I’m really excited to be part of it. 

I was working for a large corporate law firm before joining Trussle and wanted to see the impact of my work. At Trussle, everything you do can have a direct impact on the success of the company and that’s really exciting. I also loved the people I met when I interviewed at Trussle. 

## Why did you decide to change direction?
It was time for a change. I graduated from Cambridge, got a training contract and stayed at the same law firm the whole time working in corporate law. This is my first step out of the law bubble and into the big wide world… 

I’d thought for a while that I wasn’t fully sure about my career path, and I didn’t see a downside in doing something different - it’s always good to have some new experiences and add variety. 

## What does your day to day work at Trussle look like?
I look after everything to do with legal, finance, compliance, and HR. It’s pretty broad! I love the variety - today I’ve been doing some corporate legal work; yesterday I was doing some HR. It’s my job to manage the internal running of the business to make sure we have the right processes and structures in place as we scale up, and the right foundations to build on as we grow.  

## What do you think will be the biggest challenge you’ll face in your role?
Although it’s exciting, getting to grips with so many different things will take a lot of hard work. It’s a huge change from my previous role and previous environment, so it takes some adjustment. Then the fact that there’s always loads to do - it’s a case of having to prioritise tasks according to what will advance the business most.

## What do you like most about your role?
I’m learning something new every day. I love being able to say that I love my job - it’s energising and inspiring!

## Do you have any hobbies?
Seeing my family and friends. I’m a country girl originally from Wiltshire so for me there’s nothing better than getting some fresh air on a country walk and ending up in the pub. I love gin too. And travel. 

## Do you have a favourite type of gin…?
There’s a micro distillery down towards Guildford called Silent Pool - it’s a beautiful setting. Add gin, tonic and scenery together - perfect.  

## Favourite film?
Gladiator is up there. Plus the old school classic Disney films (Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin - any way to release my inner child).
