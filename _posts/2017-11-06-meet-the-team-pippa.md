  Despite the myths, there’s no set rule for the amount you can borrow for your
  mortgage - it depends on a number of factors, just one of which is your
  salary.

## Job title: Head of Business Operations
_Pippa looks after the internal running of the business, and it’s a big role - managing everything to do with finance, HR, legal, and compliance. Now we’re a team of over 50, Pippa’s got her work cut out, but with a background in law, we know she’s up to the job!_

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I had a terrible personal experience getting a mortgage myself and thought there must be a better way of doing this! Now I know there is, and I’m excited to be part of it. 

I was working for a big corporate law firm before joining Trussle and wanted to see the impact of my work. At Trussle, everything you do can have a direct impact on the success of the company and that’s really exciting. I also loved the people I met when I interviewed at Trussle! 

## Why did you decide to change direction?
It was time for a change! I graduated from Cambridge, got a training contract and stayed at the same law firm the whole time working in corporate law. This is my first step out of the law bubble and into the big wide world… 

I’d thought for a while that I wasn’t sure about my career path, and I didn’t see a downside in doing something different - it’s always good to have some new experiences and add variety. 

## What does your day to day work at trussle look like?
I look after everything to do with legal, finance, compliance, and HR. It’s pretty broad! I love the variety - today I’ve been doing some corporate legal work; yesterday I was doing some HR. It’s my job to improve the internal running of the business to make sure we have the right structure in place as we scale up, and the right foundations to build on as we grow.  

## What do you think will be the biggest challenge you’ll face in your role?
Although it’s exciting, getting to grips with so many different things. Also it’s a huge change from my previous role and previous environment, so it takes some adjustment. Then the fact that there’s always loads to do!

## What do you like most about your role?
I’m learning something every day. I love being able to say that I love my job - I never could before!

## Do you have any hobbies?
Seeing my family and friends. I’m a country girl from Wiltshire originally so for me there’s nothing better than getting some fresh air on a country walk and ending up in the pub. I love gin too. And travel. 

## Do you have a favourite type of gin…?
There’s a micro distillery down in the Surrey hills called Silent Pool gin - it’s a beautiful setting.  

## Favourite film?
Old school classic Disney films, although Sleeping Beauty is my favourite.
