Curtis is the newest mortgage adviser to join Trussle, having learnt his trade at a traditional broker. He saw how technology could improve the process of finding a mortgage, and when he came across Trussle, Curtis knew it was the company for him.

## What attracted you to Trussle?
I used to work for a traditional mortgage broker and from what I saw there, the whole industry was pretty old school - technology was kept to a minimum! Being part of a younger generation than most of my colleagues, I thought there were things we could do to improve the journey for customers, but also for us as the adviser. When I was looking for a job and came across Trussle, I knew it was the place I wanted to be. I like what Trussle’s trying to achieve and the ethos, plus it’s exciting to be part of a startup.

## What’s your working background?
I’ve been a mortgage broker since I left school and I was working for an estate agency-based broker firm. I knew I wanted to work in finance and I enjoy speaking to lots of different types of people, so it’s ideal really. 

## What’s the best thing about your job?
Working with first-time buyers. Often they don’t really know what to expect and they presume they won’t be able to get a good mortgage. Finding them a great deal and helping them out is really rewarding as they’re always so grateful. 

## How do you spend your spare time?
I love music - I spent most of my time DJing. I usually play at big parties, although I’ve played at XOYO once. I’m always listening to new music and practising mixing, and it’s good to watch other people DJ and talk to them about it. I’m big into driving too and do a lot of track days. 

## What’s the biggest challenge you think you’ll face in your role?
The sheer volume of customers we can help at Trussle. Although I’ll be helping more people at Trussle than at my last company, the increase in volume doesn’t equal an increase in effort as the technology makes the process more efficient. Also changing habits from conventional broking to the Trussle model. At Trussle, you find out as much information about your customer as quickly as possible to save them time. At a traditional brokers, you’d be on the phone all the time getting little bits of information, taking more of the customer’s time unnecessarily. 

## Favourite film?
Shawshank Redemption

## Tell us a surprising fact about you...
I have a double barrelled first name. My mum liked the name Curtis and my dad liked Dean, so they just combined both.

## If you weren’t a mortgage adviser, what would you be?
A DJ! 

## And who’s your favourite DJ?
Jackmaster
