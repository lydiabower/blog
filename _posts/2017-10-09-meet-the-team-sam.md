Sam joins Trussle as part of our Customer Success team after a few years working in the traditional mortgage market. Fed up of the endless paperwork and lack of flexibility, Sam decided she wanted a change and found just what she was looking for in Trussle.

## What made you want to join Trussle?
The mortgage industry is moving online and I wanted to be part of that transition. Every other company I’ve worked for has been completely paper-based and the amount of paper we wasted pained me! I knew there had to be a better way and then I came across Trussle. The company is completely different to any other company I know and I knew it was where I wanted to be. 

## What do you think will be your favourite part of the job?
Seeing how the company grows. We’re ahead of the game as everything is becoming more online and as we’re already doing things that way I’m excited to see how everything turns out.

## Have you worked in Customer Success before?
I was working with high net worth clients in Knightsbridge before joining Trussle. I was dealing with more money than I thought was possible - so much so that Harrods were used as a lender.

## How did you get into it the mortgage industry?
About 11 years ago I joined a very small mortgage company that helped people with bad credit. I wasn’t sure it was what I wanted and then I got made redundant in 2008 with the crash. It wasn’t a great time to be in mortgages so I dabbled in other areas of finance but realised mortgages were what I liked best. I came back to the field and decided to pursue my career in mortgages.

## What was your favourite subject at school?
Drama. I went to the Anna Scher theatre school in London which was good fun but I never took it that seriously. 

## What are you most afraid of?
Spiders, snakes, insects, and germs. 

## How do you spend your spare time?
I have two children - my son’s 11 and my daughter is 7, so my spare time is spent with them mainly. My son goes to a dance school and my daughter attends theatre classes. 

My childhood was filled with superheroes and comics, and I still read comics and watch the cartoon movies. I have some Batman art work too.

## Who’s your hero?
Batman. He doesn’t have any superpowers - instead it’s all gadgets, his mind, and his training. He almost makes being a superhero achievable. You know you’re never going to be Superman but Batman makes it seem a little more in reach!

## Tell us something unexpected about yourself.
I recently started adult swimming lessons as I forgot how to swim! The kids are having lessons and getting quite good so I thought it was about time I should take some lessons too. I did kickboxing until a few years ago and I’m going back next week.
