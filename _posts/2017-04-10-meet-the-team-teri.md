**Role at Trussle:** Head of Customer Success

Last week, we welcomed Teri to the Trussle team. Hailing from Vancouver, Teri touched down in London last week and hit the ground running. Teri will be heading up the Customer Success team, making sure we deliver the best experience possible, and we’re excited to have her on board.

## What brought you to London?
I’m Canadian and was living and working in Vancouver for Hootsuite. I always wanted to go back to London immediately after being there on trips - I felt like I could never get enough of the city. I started looking for jobs in London and found the perfect role at Trussle, and I knew it was the right decision. My grandad is Scottish, too, so that made the whole visa situation easier. 

## What made you want to join Trussle?
During my time at Hootsuite, the company grew from around 100 employees to over 1000. I realised my favourite time over those years was the period of rapid growth quite early on, so I wanted to work somewhere small with a plan to grow quickly. After doing some research about Trussle, I knew I wanted to join - the role was great and my morals and ambitions aligned with the company’s. 

## What’s your favourite thing about Trussle?
It’s a great place to work and the product offers real value. I noticed immediately how much collaboration there is - everyone’s equally committed and ready to jump in, share notes, and brainstorm, regardless of their job title. Product-wise, what Trussle offers makes sense. It doesn’t take long to explain how Trussle works, and straight away it’s easy to see the value in what we do. 

## Any hidden talents?
I’m a big karaoke fan. It’s my favourite way to wind down and relax - I’ve done it about once a week for the last decade, although I still need to find somewhere to go in London. An added bonus to doing karaoke regularly is the fact you get really good at public speaking. To add to the mix, I also do Brazilian jiu jitsu, which is great for cardio and building strength, and cross stitching (I mainly stitch band logos). 

## Favourite book?
House of leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski

## Pet hates?
People who walk really slowly - although I feel that may be a London-wide sentiment...

## What’s the best thing about your job?
Having the opportunity to make a real impact to overall customer experience, making life easier for customers as well as the team. I love having the freedom and flexibility to make a positive change in a short amount of time - it’s really exciting.
