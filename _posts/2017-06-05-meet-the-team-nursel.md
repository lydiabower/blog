### Job title: Senior Digital Acquisition Manager

Nursel joins Trussle after working in a number of startups over the past few years. Born in Turkey and growing up in Germany, Nursel speaks the most languages out of anyone in the office. 

### For anyone not in Marketing, what does your job entail?
My job is centered around driving paid traffic to our website. The ultimate aim is to find people who are looking to buy a home or save money on their mortgage and convince them to use our service.  

### Talk us through a day in the life of your job?
Generally, I’ll check the performance of our paid acquisition channels - this includes Google, Bing and Facebook. Then I’ll analyse data, make improvements, and optimise based on the findings. I’ll also write ad copy and test the ad copy for all channels to improve performance. The aim is always to get the lowest CPA (cost per acquisition) for each channel. It’s also important to be on top of the latest tools and features for paid acquisition channels. 

### What were you doing before joining Trussle?
I’ve been working in digital for over ten years in permanent and contracting roles including different startups. 

### What’s your favourite part of London?
I’ve moved around in London, but I’ve always lived south. My favourite part has to be Peckham - I like that it’s so diverse. All of London is diverse - it’s one of the great things about the city, but Peckham is especially cool and arty. There’s loads on offer in terms of music and bars, and it’s the crowd I like to be surrounded with. I also love that there’s positive movements happening there, and every time I go there’s something new in the way of restaurants and bars. 

### What do you do in your spare time?
Weekends are usually centered around our daughter (she’s nearly five) and activities with her and her friends. We love going to little festivals in a local park with food and drinks.

### How does life in Germany differ from life in the UK?
It’s surprising that two well-off countries could be so different, especially because we’re technically similar in a lot of ways. When I moved to the UK I wasn’t expecting to see much difference in people compared to Germany, but it wasn’t the case at all. The pace of life here is much faster (at least in London anyway), and I don’t think Germans and Brits share the same sense of humour!

### How would you describe Germans?
They’re very direct! You rarely come across a reserved German. They really like to talk about things - even things that we’d find uncomfortable here. Everyone learns English at school and they love to practice it when they come across an English native speaker. Since I moved away from Germany I've felt a bit disconnected with their humour - I'm definitely more British in that sense!

### What do you like about Trussle?
I like the product, which I know is boring to say but it’s important and I can relate to it. The fact the company is still at an early stage means I can have a lot of impact, which is exciting. It also means that I can learn a lot about the business, and make the most of the opportunities that come with it. 

### Favourite TV show?
I’m really looking forward to Game of Thrones starting again.
