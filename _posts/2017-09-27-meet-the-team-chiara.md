Chiara entered the startup world once she'd completed a degree in engineering at university in Pisa. Chiara joins Trussle as a software engineer after swapping the blue waters of Sardinia for the damp drizzle of London.

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I wanted to be part of a good team - being part of a team is like being part of an engine where all the parts work together, and that’s what I liked about Trussle. There’s a lot of collaboration and everyone tries to help each other rather than working alone. I was working at a fintech startup previously and wanted to work somewhere similar. It’s an exciting environment at Trussle and there’s a lot of opportunity to make a difference.  

## How did you get into software development?
I studied engineering at university in Pisa and got into it that way. I used to cycle past the tower every morning on the way to uni and had to do a mandatory smile as I passed because I knew I’d be in so many pictures!

## Tell us about your life in Sardinia!
Sardinia is beautiful, but I always think twice before recommending it as a place to visit. Sardinians don’t make it easy for tourists - the infrastructure there isn’t like it is on mainland Italy and Sardinians don’t tend to speak English very well. It’s a great place to go and see nature at its finest as parts of the island are completely unspoiled. 

## Did you always know you’d move to London?
It was never part of my plan to move to London - it just happened! I thought it would be too big, too cold, with too much traffic, and I was absolutely right. I’ve now been here four years and I’ve only been back to Sardinia in the summer once. I’m always worried it’ll be too hot - it’s funny how you adjust to different climates. September’s the best month to go as the sea’s had all summer to warm up and it’s much less crowded. 

## What’s your favourite part of your job?
I like the idea that you’re actually building something and you get to see the end result - it’s really satisfying. It’s good when you can concentrate and totally immerse yourself in the code so you don’t notice the time passing. 	

## How do you spend your spare time?
I like reading and I get through a lot of books reading on my commute. I usually go to the library and just pick the books with the most interesting titles. I always read in English as it’s much more effort finding books written in Italian. 

## When did you learn English?
In Italy we start learning English at school when we’re eight, but it was all writing and listening which I found difficult. I wasn’t great at English until I moved here and was pushed into speaking it. You always learn it eventually that way! One day it just clicked and I stopped translating and started thinking in English, which is much less tiring than translating everything from Italian. 

## Favourite thing to do in London?
I like the parks in London so whenever I can I like to go for long walks in the park. This summer I’ve spent a lot of time in the Olympic park.
