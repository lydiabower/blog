## Job title: Software Engineer

_Having worked for a big company over the past two years, Joe joins Trussle as a software engineer keen to embrace the small company vibe (although at the rate we’re growing, this might not be the case for long!)._

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I was attracted to the size and setup of Trussle - I wanted to join a smaller team so I could get more involved in the day to day life of the business, rather than just the technical side of things. I like being able to see the results of my work and getting feedback from the people using what I’ve helped make. This is hard when you’re in a big company, but it’s a big part of life at Trussle. I felt like a little cog in a very big wheel in my previous role, so it’s great to work on an emerging product in the existing field of mortgages, making changes that will benefit real people. 

Maybe most importantly I liked the culture at Trussle too!

## What were you doing before joining Trussle?
I was developing the software for a sports fitness tracking product and as part of the job I lived in Belgrade, Serbia for six months - that was an interesting experience! I went on my own but managed to learn about ten words the whole time I was there. Coming from western Europe it was a great way of life as living costs were so cheap, so I had a ball eating and drinking out all the time.  

The only downside was how unhealthy I got. I had a blood test when I got back and I had the cholesterol levels of an old man! The food there is so greasy - it’s all grilled meat but usually covered in Serbian cheese. 

## How do you spend your spare time?
The usual - running, cycling, drinking and going out, eating, and reading - I’m into history and geopolitics. I play around with computers too.

## How did you get into development?
I was always interested in electrics as a kid - I used to connect bits of string with pieces of duplo which I think is what kickstarted my inquisitivity with computers. I liked using both software and hardware to make something work, and it went from there. 

## What do you do on a day to day basis?
As I’ve only been here a week, I’m working on few small familiarisation tasks while fixing issues to get used to the code. We (the development team) have a stand up every morning to discuss what we’ve done and what’s on the agenda for the day… then I’ll make some toast. 

## What was your first job?
I worked as a Saturday boy at a local locksmiths. They weren’t so hot on the health and safety, so as a 16 year old I was drilling into walls fitting fire alarms.

## What’s the best part of your job?
For me it’s having the opportunity to learn new things all the time. As a software engineer you’re never going to get to a point where you know everything. There are always things to learn and techniques to try, and new things to get involved with.
