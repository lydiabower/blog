Stefan joins Trussle as a full-stack engineer, working on delivering new tools for our customers to help make the process of getting a mortgage through Trussle even more simple. 

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I liked the idea of working for a startup but I also liked the business idea behind Trussle. As someone who doesn’t like to deal with paperwork and take time out to make trips to banks or offices, I saw the value in Trussle. Trussle makes the process of getting a mortgage as smooth and frictionless as possible, which is something I’d opt for. 

## How did you get into software development?
I’ve had a passion for computers since I was a child, and I learnt how to tinker with operating systems and install different things on computers. I learnt programming in school and from then, I knew it was the way I wanted to go. 

## Talk us through your day to day life at Trussle...
Currently, I’m working on new features for the Growth team, looking at the customer onboarding part of our product. We’re focusing on modernising the user experience and I’m bringing my own contribution and ideas to the table when we work out how we’re going to get that done. 

## Who do you work most closely with?
Ben and Jonny - we’re all engineers working for the Growth team. We work on separate things most of the time but depending on how our priorities shift our work will overlap. Everyone’s been very supportive in showing me the ins and outs of the product. 

## What do you like most about your job?
I like the problem solving part - taking on new challenges and finding a solution. I also like the collaborative aspect, working with different minds and different ways of thinking then trying to find consensus. If you can’t find a solution on your own, putting two heads together means you usually manage to find one. 

## Where can we find you when you’re not at work?
I’ve got a few hobbies - I like video games, cycling, photography, and trying out my DIY skills. 

## What made you want to move to London?
I’ve been here just over a year and so far I’m enjoying the buzz of the city. I’m from Romania and lived there until I was 24, then I moved to Dublin and was living there until I moved to London. There were lots more job opportunities in London and it’s home to more amenities than Dublin. Since it’s the biggest capital in Europe, I wanted to try living here for myself and to see how the lifestyle compares. I’m not sure I’ll retire here but I’ll definitely be sticking around for a while. 

## What’s your favourite thing to do in London?
Photography. It’s the most pleasant thing to do when I go out. London’s such a diverse city and it’s always full of so many surprises. It’s hard to go out and not see something that catches your eye.

## Favourite music?
I used to DJ for alternative music events every now and then so my music taste in quite eclectic, from old school rock to electronic to industrial and extreme metal. It’s hard to choose a favourite band when you listen to so many different types of music.
