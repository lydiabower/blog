It may be tempting to send in anything and everything to do with your finances when you’re applying for a mortgage, but it’s not necessary.

Once you’ve completed your mortgage application with Trussle, we’ll ask you to upload your documents. Before you start searching through old files and digging out bank statements dating back to 2003, hold fire! Lenders require a fair amount of information before agreeing to give you a mortgage, but you can save yourself time and effort by only uploading the documents they need to see. 

There are a few things you can do to make sure we can help with your application as quickly as possible. We’ve created a complete list of everything you’ll need to apply for a mortgage to help.


## Documents you’ll need: A complete list

Whether you’re applying for a mortgage or you’re looking to remortgage, there are a few documents lenders will always want to see. 

- **Three months of bank statements**

As most banks now offer online banking, the easiest way to send us your bank statements is to log in to your online banking account and download your statements directly to your computer. There’s no need to scan anything this way, and the statements will be automatically saved to PDF format. 

- **Three months of payslips**

Many people now receive their payslips online which makes it easy to download as a PDF. If you receive paper payslips, you’ll need to scan them and send as a PDF. You can scan multiple payslips on one page rather than a page for each. 

- **Your ID**

You’ll need to provide a scanned copy of either your passport or driving license. 

- **Your address ID**

Council tax bills, utility bills, and bank statements are all accepted forms of address ID. They must be dated within the last three months.


### If you’re self-employed (as a Sole Trader/Limited Company Director/Partnerships/LLP), in addition to the documents above, there are some extra documents you’ll need to provide:

- 2 to 3 years SA302s and 2 to 3 years accounts

- Some lenders will also ask for 3 months business bank statements. 



### If you’re buying a home, you’ll need to provide a few extra documents. 
**You’ll need:**

- Proof of deposit - either a saving statement or a bank statement
- Or, if the deposit is a gift, we’ll provide you with a ‘Confirmation of Gifted Deposit’ form for you to fill in, alongside three months of bank statements of the person gifting the deposit.

### If you’re remortgaging:
- You’ll need a current mortgage statement

## Be aware, there are a few documents you might also be asked for: 
- Evidence of a bonus 
- Visa evidence
- Sometimes, if you’re remortgaging, you’ll need to provide debt consolidation statements.


## Uploading documents with Trussle

### Do you accept photos of documents?
Unfortunately not. Our advisers need to see scanned copies of documents before they can progress your application because lenders won’t accept photos as proof of the original. 

### What format should documents be in?
We only accept PDFs, so make sure all documents have been converted to PDF before uploading.

### Can I include all my documents in one PDF file?
Putting all documents on one PDF slows down the application process -  your adviser then has to spend time searching through pages to find what they’re looking for. Scan each document separately and keep each on a separate PDF, clearly named, so we can process your application as quickly and smoothly as possible.    

### Is there a file size limit?
Yes - files can’t be bigger than 5mb. If all your documents are on separate PDFs, this shouldn’t be a problem. 


## 5 things to remember when uploading your documents 

1. Don’t send photos! They won’t be accepted, and we’ll need to ask you to send in scanned copies instead, delaying your application. 

2. Make sure PDFs aren’t password protected, as we won’t be able to access them!

3. Send your documents as separate PDFs, rather than uploading them as one long attachment. This saves our advisers from spending time going through pages of documents, speeding up your application. 

4. Name your documents. Having a clearly labelled PDF makes it easy for your adviser to find exactly what they need quickly and easily.

5. Check which documents you can download as PDFs (such as bank statements) before printing and scanning to save yourself time and effort. Almost all banks now offer downloadable statements.
