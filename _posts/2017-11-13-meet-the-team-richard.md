## Job Title: Customer Success Manager
Richard joined Trussle to make the most of the opportunities that come with a small and fast-growing company. He’s got plenty of experience getting mortgages through to completion, helping make our customers some of the happiest around.

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I liked Trussle’s style and the environment when I visited the office. You can get more involved in a smaller company and your voice is heard when making decisions on how to do things. I also like the fact that Trussle gives you the opportunity to experience different areas of work you might not in a bigger company, so it’s good for progression. 

## Where were you before joining Trussle? 
I was working for a lifetime mortgage lender as a Business Support Analyst. It was my job to maintain and look after the phone systems and the day to day running of the office database. 

## How did you get into the mortgage industry?
I’ve always worked in mortgages after falling into it about 12 years ago. I took a role in logistics to get some office experience, then I came across a mortgage broker role. From then on I’ve been in the mortgage world, working for a few different brokers, lenders and mortgage servicers.

## What excites you most about your role?
The opportunities that come with a growing company and working somewhere at the forefront of a changing industry. 

## Do you have any hobbies?
I’m an Arsenal season ticket holder, and I love playing football and video games, going to bars, then cooking and DIY - weird adult things you have to do that end up becoming hobbies! 

## Signature dish?
I can turn my hand to most things and give it a go - I’m pretty experimental in the kitchen!

## Best bar in London?
It depends what you’re looking for. 12 Pins in Finsbury Park is great for watching football - they open it up on match days and it’s rammed with a bar at the front and the back. There’s an old German style beer hall called Munich Cricket Club near Victoria that does German steins and good food, then near the office I like Boxpark in Shoreditch - there’s a good drink culture and London Cocktail Club next door is hidden off but a great find. 
 
## Tell us something unexpected about you.
I’ve never broken a bone. 

## Favourite film?
Shawshank Redemption is everyone’s go to favourite but it is a great film. I like all the Tarantino films, then Coming to America gets me every time. 

## Is there another company in the startup space you’re interested in?
I’ve always admired the Google setup, and the new offices they’re building near Kings Cross look insane. I like a company Andy Rubin (one of the founders of Android) set up called [Essential](https://www.essential.com/ "Essential"), as they’re doing things people might not expect. Unfortunately, the phone they’ve made isn’t great, but I’m hoping the next model will be amazing.
