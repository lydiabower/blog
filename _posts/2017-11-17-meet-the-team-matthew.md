Matt recently became our first Vice President of Engineering, joining the team to propel us towards our goal of providing instant mortgage approvals and lifetime mortgage monitoring.

## Why did you decide to join Trussle?
I’ve been through the process of getting a mortgage twice myself so I understand the pain - it’s clear the mortgage industry needs changing. 

On a personal level, I know people on modest incomes who’ve worked hard to save up but have still struggled to get onto the property ladder. It’s fundamentally not fair, and that drove my interest in the industry in general.

Technically, the mortgage problem is an interesting one to solve. Mastering the analytical side of things - the algorithms and the automation - is useless unless the person on the other end feels comfortable with the advice they receive. It’s about balancing the technical and the personal.

Homeownership is such a personal and significant event in life, so if we can prove people feel comfortable with automated mortgage advice, it proves that automation can work for most decisions in FinTech. 

## What will your role entail?
I’ll be working closely with the engineering team, continuing to build great product. My vision is to have a business-focused product engineering team - that’s the only kind of team that will allow us to deliver Trussle’s vision. I love building teams and finding the right people to solve problems - that’s what’s always driven me as a manager. A lot of my role will centre around building the engineering culture to be in step with Trussle culture, as I’ve seen in some larger companies the two can become quite separate. 

## What were you doing before?
I was managing engineering teams at Funding Circle, responsible for building out their future core exchange platform.Funding Circle’s aim was similar to Trussle’s - they want to make getting approved for small business loans an instant process. 

## What do you think will be the hardest part of your job?
The technical challenge - building algorithms and working towards automation - is achievable. The harder part will be around ensuring people are comfortable with the advice they receive. We want people to understand that the advice we give is personal to them and matches their needs and circumstances.
Building a long term relationship with our customers is also something we have to get right. We want to make sure they’re continuously on the right deal and that means constant interaction. Keeping them engaged throughout their mortgage lifetime will be an interesting challenge.

## How did you get into engineering?
I studied Maths at uni but I was always interested in building things, so software engineering seemed like a natural fit. I love anything fast paced that you have to throw yourself into which is why I love working at startups. 

## Is there another company you admire for their engineering achievements?
The obvious answer is Google. They have an incredibly mature development process while still being able to innovate. That’s something I hope to emulate at Trussle.

## Do you have any hobbies? 
I play the trumpet and I’ve recently started the trombone - I always thought I’d be a musician when I was growing up. I used to play in an orchestra and a jazz band when I was younger, but now I just play for myself (and the neighbours…). 

## If you could have one superpower, what would it be?
It’d have to be mindreading.

## Favourite TV series?
My favourite nerdy series is Battlestar Galactica (the reboot) and serious series would have to be The Wire. 

## If you founded your own company, what would it be doing?
Before I joined Funding Circle I considered starting my own company in the mortgage space. It’s always been an area I’ve had an interest in so when I saw the opportunity to join Trussle, it was too good an opportunity to turn down.
