We were excited to welcome Ushma to Trussle last week, where she’s already making a great impact on the mortgage team. Ushma is looking like a frontrunner for the friendliest face in the office (she’s a self proclaimed talkaholic), and also brings the total number of vegetarians in the office to two, which Jonny (veggie number one) was very excited about. 

### Role at Trussle: Mortgage Adviser

## Describe yourself in a few words:
Talkative, foodie, fun, OCD, bubbly, a bit crazy…

## What excited you most about joining Trussle?
I love the environment and ethos. A lot of companies say the customer is at the core of what they do, but with Trussle, that’s really true. Getting a mortgage is centered around the customer - everything’s mobile, and people can apply at their convenience, making the process easy and seamless. Trussle is going to be the next big thing, and I want to be a part of it.

I like the office environment too - everyone’s so helpful and there’s lots of collaboration across departments. 

## How would you spend your ideal day?
I’m a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I love cleaning. So I’d do a bit of that, then mainly just shopping...

## Do you have any hobbies?
People are always surprised to hear that I’m a pool player. I used to play professionally and entered quite a few competitions - most of the time I was the only girl there. Boys used to get quite intimidated by it! I went to a work conference recently and some of the men didn’t believe me when I said I could play. We bet on it, and I came home with full pockets.  

## Favourite food?
Mexican 

## Favourite film?
Titanic

## Favourite place to go on holiday?
Dubai. I’ve been 4 times and I’m still not bored - everything is so luxurious there. 

## What’s your favourite thing about your job at Trussle?
I never stop talking and my family and friends always come to me for advice, so talking and advising for a living suits me perfectly!
