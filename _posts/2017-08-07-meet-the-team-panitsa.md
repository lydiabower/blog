Panitsa joins Trussle as a Customer Success Associate after a stint in Australia working in the dreamy Whitsunday islands.

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I liked that Trussle was a young and vibrant company, dealing with something that a lot of people are scared of - mortgages! I liked the concept of making mortgages accessible, which Trussle is doing in an up-to-date way - modern expectations are different now and Trussle understands that. Company culture is really important to me too, and when I came to see the office, I got a good vibe. I think startups on the whole value culture more than some other companies, and that suits me.

## What were you doing before joining Trussle?
I moved to Australia on my own and lived on Daydream island in the Whitsundays (off Australia’s east coast), working as a Retail Coordinator for the hotel’s gift shop. The hotel itself was awful - like the Australian version of Fawlty Towers! I was just about ready to come home when the island was wiped out by a cyclone and the hotel was completely ruined, so it made sense to come back. 

Before I went travelling, I was working as an office manager in London for another small company.

## What made you want to travel?
Australia has always been a dream, and the opportunity arose so I thought why not? I went for it, and I had the best time. I took a cruise by myself while I was there around the South Pacific which was incredible, although being at sea for 24 days felt like a long stint. 

My favourite place in Australia was probably Melbourne. It’s very European and reminded me of London, if London had better weather and people there were in a less of a rush.

## What do you think will be the best thing about your job?
I’ve always had an element of customer focus in my previous roles but I’m excited to work almost exclusively with customers. I used to work for Apple on the shop floor, and as an office manager I had some exposure to external customers, but I’d mainly work with people in the business. I’m really looking forward to talking to lots of people in this role - I think it’s going to be really varied, especially as it’s working in a field I haven’t worked in before.

## Favourite things to do?
Going to art galleries. My favourite in London is the Saatchi gallery as there’s lots of fashion and it’s contemporary. Then I’m always in the cinema - I love my Cineworld card! I also love immersive theatre events. I went to one recently called Chambers of Flavour which was amazing, and Secret Cinema is always incredible. The budget and scale is just huge - every single detail is accounted for!

## Favourite film?
I watched Wayne’s World recently and remembered how much I love it. I’ve also got really into Harry Potter again.

## What was your first job?
I worked at Lush when I was at university in Reading studying Psychology. The shop smells good for the first half an hour and then it really starts to get to you. Also the glitter never properly comes off so you’re always a bit sparkly...
