With a background in journalism, Dilpreet isn’t your average mortgage broker! She joins Trussle with a wealth of experience, having worked for both a bank and an estate agency based broker firm. Dilpreet made the mistake of sharing that she’s an expert baker, so the whole office is waiting patiently for a delivery of brownies...

### What made you want to join Trussle?
I was working as a mortgage adviser based in an estate agency and wanted to try working in a different way. I had interviews with over ten brokers but Trussle stood out - no other company was so forward thinking. Trussle was also the only company I came across to use a new process. The only way to achieve different results is to use a different process, and I loved Trussle’s ambition!
 
### Have you always been a mortgage adviser? 
No! I worked as a journalist for three years after finishing my degree in English Literature at Reading University. I was freelancing so it was difficult, but I loved it - I worked in some really cool places, like Fabulous magazine and The X Factor (the series with One Direction). I was mainly looking after the magazine which they brought out for that series only, and did a lot of interviews with contestants and judges. One of the perks was going to the Summertime Ball, but it was hectic - I’d do an interview then have to dash home to write up the copy and have it written and ready to send by 6am the next day. 
 
Although it was great fun, I wanted more stability and so moved into financial services. I started working at Lloyds TSB as a personal banker and was then sponsored to take my exams to become a mortgage adviser. 
 
### What made you want to be a mortgage adviser?
The stability, mainly. Lloyds TSB sponsored me to do CEMAP (the qualification you need to become a mortgage adviser) and I thought it’d be a good thing to do. I really enjoyed the work - you get to meet lots of people, so I decided to go for it, and haven’t looked back since!
 
### What do you like the most about working at Trussle?
The team is great, and the morale. There’s such a good atmosphere in the office, which is important considering you spend as much time at work as you do at home! I also like that Trussle is very progressive. I don’t feel like I’ll be working in the same way forever, which is good - I like to be constantly learning new things. 
 
### How do you spend your spare time?
I bake, go out with friends, travel, and I gym a fair bit. Oh and I’m a massive foodie - I’m always trying new restaurants...  which is a big part of why I go to the gym! I like to eat what I want and know I’m balancing it out. 
 
### Best thing about working at a startup?
I love that any changes you suggest are taken on board and your ideas could make a real difference, which in turn makes you want to contribute even more.
 
### What’s your favourite thing about your job?
I love that I’m challenged every day as every customer’s circumstances are different. 
 
### Anything we’d be surprised to know about you?
I’m a part time baker! At the moment I’m taking orders from friends and family, but it can get a little crazy at times - over Christmas I had 15 Oreo cheesecakes to make. I think my next career move (in about 40 years time!) will be to baking full time. It’s so therapeutic.
