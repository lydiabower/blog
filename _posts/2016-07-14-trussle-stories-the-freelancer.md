At Trussle we put our customers first. We speak with them regularly to find out why they choose our online service to get a mortgage instead of their bank or a traditional high-street adviser.
It’s clear from speaking to our customers how unique they all are; from teachers, nurses, and church reverends, to store managers, company directors, and startup founders — we’ve spoken to them all!

In this story, we hear from a freelance designer who almost didn’t use our service at all…

## A bitter taste

Two years ago, James was almost ready to move into his new home — a lovely new flat in a modern high-rise development. Unfortunately finding a suitable mortgage for it wasn’t easy.

> “I tried getting a mortgage from several banks directly but they rejected my application each time. The frustrating thing was, they never gave me a good reason why.”

He then approached a number of high-street brokers who were all unable to help. In the end, James’ only choice was to use a specialist lender who charged a much higher rate. He took it, hoping he could find a better deal when he remortgaged.

> “I was dreading having to go through the whole ordeal again when I needed to remortgage later on.”

When the time came to remortgage, James avoided the banks and large brokerage firms. Instead he decided to use an independent mortgage broker recommended by a friend. At the same time, James came across Trussle.

## A fresh start

> “I was intrigued by what Trussle claimed they could do, but I worried that an online service wouldn’t be able to handle my complex situation.”

So James spread his bets. He began the process with the independent broker who recommended a great low-rate deal. Then he compared it with the recommendation he received from Trussle.

> “The rate the independent broker found was slightly lower, so I figured I’d go with it. But after a quick call with a Trussle adviser, it turned out that the independent broker had made a mistake.”

We built Trussle from the ground up to accommodate a wide variety of customer situations — it makes our service extremely capable of keeping track of lenders’ strict eligibility criteria. And that’s where the independent broker had slipped up.

> “My broker recommended a lender that didn’t mortgage flats higher than a certain number of floors. Had he submitted my application, it would have been rejected. Again!”

Frustrated after a string of disappointments from several banks and brokers, James was confident that using Trussle was the way forward.

After a busy day at work he uploaded his documents at around midnight. We were able to submit his mortgage application just 12 hours later.

> “I couldn’t believe how straightforward the whole process was. I assumed that my circumstances would make it difficult, but Trussle made it super easy. I’m actually kind of looking forward to remortgaging with them again!”
