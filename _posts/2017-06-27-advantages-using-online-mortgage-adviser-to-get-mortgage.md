## Who carries out conveyancing and does it matter who I use?
Conveyancing is carried out by a solicitor, conveyancer, or property lawyer. However, even though all solicitors are qualified in property law, not all have experience in this area. Make sure you get the best service and expertise by choosing a solicitor who specialises in residential property. 
 
There are a number of ways to find a conveyancer. You can search comparison websites online, ask for recommendations, or go to a local solicitor’s branch. Your estate agent is also likely to have recommendations. 
 
You can use any solicitor, although it’s always a good idea to get a few quotes before committing so you can see who’s offering the best-value deal. 
 
Lenders will allow any solicitor that’s on their ‘lender’s panel’, but be aware that some lenders will charge a fee if you go with a conveyancer not on their list. It’s a good idea to choose a solicitor on the lender’s panel even if other you find a cheaper deal elsewhere, as those on the panel tend to be recommended for for their speed and efficiency. 
 
Estate agents often have their own conveyancing partners but are likely to receive commission for recommendations, so they might not recommend the cheapest deal. However, using an estate agent’s solicitor can be beneficial, as everything is then kept in-house, helping speed up the process. 
 
## What happens once I’ve found a conveyancer?
Your solicitor will write up their contract before starting the conveyancing process, setting out their fees and terms of engagement. Once you’ve agreed on the terms, your solicitor will get the conveyancing in motion. 
 
You’ll need to find a conveyancer as soon as your offer is accepted on a property, as this is when the conveyancing process begins. It finishes upon completion - when the money is transferred and the keys are handed over.
 
## The conveyancing process: step by step
As conveyancing covers all the legalities of buying a home and remortgaging, there’s a lot to do, which is why it can sometimes hold up the mortgage process. However, be patient - searches can take time, but it’s important to get all the information you need before completion.
