![The Trussle team celebrates 100 Trustpilot reviews!]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/100_reviews_blog.png)

One of the perks of building and launching a new service to the public is receiving feedback from our brilliant customers. It’s always a thrill to read a new review!

Why not take a look, over at our [Trustpilot profile](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/trussle.com)? :)

It took exactly one year and 29 days to receive our 100th review, and we’d like to say a big thank-you to all of you who shared your Trussle experience online! We read every one, and your feedback helps us to constantly improve our service.

This time last year we were thrilled to receive our first review from our first ever customer, Dexter. It was a 1000 word write-up full of useful feedback. We responded in our blog article, [Dear Dexter](https://trussle.com/blog/dear-dexter).

That was just the beginning. 99 reviews later, we’re proud to be rated an ‘Excellent’ 9.3/10 on Trustpilot with more than 9/10 of you rating us 5*!

We have many favourite reviews. Here are some of them…

> “We've now got a shiny new mortgage thanks to Trussle. And despite being first time buyers, self employed, and in a rush, it was still **<span style="color:#4AC64A">less stressful than some takeaways I've ordered online.</span>**” [Marcus](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5879ec6d8a103103cc1b209a)

> "In all of my property purchases **<span style="color:#4AC64A">I have never had as smooth an experience as with Trussle</span>**. I would not hesitate to recommend them and  will be using Trussle again in the future." [Simon Dance](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5888b3e37b45660ac890214d)

> "**<span style="color:#4AC64A">Took the guesswork out of getting a mortgage</span>**. Discussed my financial requirements and found a provider that worked within my needs. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get a mortgage." [Matt Barber](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/586e648c8a10310b701d49fe)

> “From start to end, Trussle has been excellent and they are definitely going to disrupt the mortgage industry with their approach and use of technology and their **<span style="color:#4AC64A">outstanding customer service!**</span>” [Pete Baston](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/584fd90590ef76043c793ec1)

> “They have been nothing but helpful from start to finish. I have to say **<span style="color:#4AC64A">Holly is like an angel sent from above</span>**: responding to emails at the weekend and after office hours, always cheerful and happy to help.” [Lucy Preston](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/57f7a9c719774d0804fdfdbc)

> “I had the option of either waiting 3 weeks for an appointment with a high street bank mortgage advisor at an inconvenient time of day, or giving Trussle a shot. Needless to say I made the right choice, **<span style="color:#4AC64A">receiving a mortgage offer before the bank in question could even arrange an initial appointment</span>**.” [Chris](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/579fc2050000ff000976d8e1)

> “After a bit of online research I came across Trussle with all their glowing reviews, so decided to give them a go. Communication was fast, efficient and with minimal fuss - all for no cost. I now tell anyone who will listen - **<span style="color:#4AC64A">this is the future of mortgage advice</span>**.” [Luke B](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5818ae90827ad309ecf9faab)
