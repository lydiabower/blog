## What brought you to Trussle?
Initially I was drawn to Trussle because most importantly, I’m interested in technology. I hated getting a mortgage the first time, and remortgaging further down the line wasn’t any better. 

I wondered whether the mortgage route could be improved, and then I came across Trussle - a company working to do just that.

## What’s your working background?
I was a Senior Software Engineer at a ticketing online platform, selling tickets for events like Adele and Justin Bieber concerts. I was there for three years, and wrote everything from scratch. I joined as the third employee, and when I left, the team had grown to over 60. It was pretty chaotic!

From Ramsbottom - grew up there and currently live in huddersfield. Live in london during the week and head back to huddersfield at the weekend. 

## What do you think your main challenges in this role will be?
Understanding the problem space, and then working out how we can make the whole process more efficient. 

## What does a typical day look like?
As soon as I get in, I’ll check if anything happened the night before that needs attention. I’ll fix any bugs, then get to work on features. Every morning we’ll get a report about anything that potentially went wrong, then we’ll need to dive deep into the code to work out how it happened. 

## How do you spend your spare time?
I live in Huddersfield, so during the week I stay in London, then head north for the weekends. I can generally be found walking my two dogs - cockapoos - in my spare time. 

I lived in London for a couple of years, then moved out to Hertfordshire, and then bought a house in Bedfordshire. I’m from the north and I prefer living in the north, so it seemed natural to end up there. It’s cheaper and it’s more relaxed - there’s not much of a rat race there compared to London. Although I love London, I got to a point where I didn’t want to be there any more. I wanted to see some countryside and trees! I do a lot of mountain biking and walking, so living near the hills is great for that. 

## How did you get into engineering?
Originally, I was a print designer. I used to design PlayStation games covers working in Birmingham - I designed the Resident Evil cover. Someone asked me if I could do a bit of website development and it went from there.

## What’s your favourite film?
Interstellar. I love Christopher Nolan.
