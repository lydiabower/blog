## What attracted you to Trussle?
Initially I was drawn to Trussle because most importantly, I’m interested in technology. I hated getting a mortgage the first time, and remortgaging further down the line wasn’t any better. 

I wondered whether the mortgage process could be improved, and then I came across Trussle - a company working to do just that.

## What’s your working background?
I was a Senior Software Engineer at an online ticketing platform, selling tickets for events like Adele and Justin Bieber concerts. I was there for three years and wrote everything from scratch. I joined as the third employee, and when I left, the team had grown to over 60. It was pretty chaotic!

## What does a typical day look like?
As soon as I get in, I’ll check if anything happened the night before that needs attention. I’ll fix any bugs, then get to work on the new website features we’re developing. Every morning we’ll get a report about anything that potentially went wrong, then we’ll need to dive deep into the code to work out how it happened. 

## How do you spend your spare time?
I live in Huddersfield, so I stay in London during the week and head north for the weekends. I can generally be found walking my two dogs - cockapoos - in my spare time. 

I lived in London for a couple of years, then moved out to Hertfordshire, and then bought a house in Bedfordshire. I’m from the north and I prefer living in the north, so it seemed natural to end up there. It’s cheaper and it’s more relaxed - there’s not much of a rat race there compared to London. Although I love London, I got to a point where I didn’t want to be there any more. I wanted to see some countryside and trees! I do a lot of mountain biking and walking, so living near the hills is great for that. 

## How did you get into engineering?
Originally, I was a print designer. I used to design PlayStation game covers working in Birmingham - I designed the Resident Evil cover. Someone asked me if I could do a bit of website development and it went from there.

## What’s your favourite film?
Interstellar. I love Christopher Nolan.
