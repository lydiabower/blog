## What were you doing before joining Trussle?
I was working for the Co-Operative bank in Manchester as part of their mortgage advice team. I relocated to Manchester for the job but always knew I’d want to come back to London - I’m from here originally and all my friends and family are based here too. 

## What attracted you to Trussle?
I liked the fact that Trussle was the first regulated online mortgage broker. Joining at this point - when it’s still a new concept - is really exciting and a great opportunity. I think everything will be moving online in the future and I’m pleased to be part of that in it’s infancy. 

## How did you get into the mortgage field?
I studied Marketing at Middlesex university but decided I didn’t want to go into Marketing once I finished. I fancied doing something more rewarding, and after a few people mentioned mortgages and finance I started a diploma in property development. Mortgages came up on the course and I enjoyed that side of things, so decided to study for my CEMAP (mortgage adviser qualification) and moved into the world of mortgage advising.  

## How do you spend your spare time?
I go to the gym a lot and do a fair bit of boxing. 

## Best thing about your job at Trussle?
The people. Everyone’s been really welcoming, supportive, and humorous, which is so important when you start somewhere new. Going forwards, I think I’ll appreciate the flexibility even more - having the option to work from home and other similar benefits are a great help. 

The Trussle system is so much more efficient than other places I’ve worked, which makes life so much easier and work much more enjoyable. 

## What was your dream job when you were younger?
I wanted to be a footballer, but the dream was short lived once I realised how much training was involved. 

## If you weren’t a mortgage adviser, what would you be?
Probably a teacher - I think I’m quite good at explaining things.
