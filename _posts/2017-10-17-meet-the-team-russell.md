## Job title: Mortgage Sales Manager

Russell joins Trussle as our first Sales Manager, helping the Mortgage team achieve their goal of finding our customers their perfect mortgage in the most hassle-free way. After years working in the traditional mortgage sector, Russell grew frustrated with the lack of innovation and wanted to try something different.

## Tell us about what you do at Trussle
Recently I’ve been doing a lot of recruiting for new mortgage advisers, but that should only be a temporary part of my role. Long term, it’s my job to help and support the Advice team. I help our advisers achieve their targets, while upskilling, training, and developing every member of the team so that they can deliver the outcomes our customers want. I’ll also help them deliver the outcomes we need as a business. 

## What made you want to join Trussle?
I was working as a Sales Manager at John Charcol but I was frustrated by the fact that the company didn’t seem to be evolving. The way things are done there are based on previous successes, but that doesn’t always mean it’s the right way forward. I saw Trussle’s plans and ambitions and wanted to get on board - it’s the future of mortgage advising. Online mortgage broking is an area that has the potential to grow hugely, and I wanted to be part of that opportunity at an early stage. 

When I first thought about joining Trussle it felt quite daunting as I’d been at John Charcol for seven years, and Trussle was doing something completely different. After thinking about it some more, I realised it wasn’t a hard decision at all - it was an opportunity I couldn’t turn down. I knew it was the right decision as soon as I started working here.

## How did you become a Sales Manager?
When I was 20, I went travelling for a year around Australia and America, and came back with no job and no money. I got my first job with First National bank as a Business Development Manager and worked my way up from there. Things got tricky during the credit crunch as almost the whole mortgage sector was wiped out, but when things started to pick up again in 2010 I joined John Charcol, first as a mortgage broker, then as a Sales Manager.

## Favourite part of your job?
Helping people achieve success. 

## What do you think will be the biggest difference at Trussle compared to a traditional broker? 
Everything is much more efficient here. The systems we use and the advisory process is the opposite to other traditional brokers I’ve worked at, where everything was done manually and was paper-based. From what I’ve seen so far at Trussle, I’d say the way we do things is efficient and slick.

## How do you spend your spare time?
I like running, and keeping fit generally. I’m pretty handy at DIY - I’ve saved myself thousands over the years doing odd jobs. 

## Favourite thing to do in London?
Having dinner by the river on a summer’s evening.
