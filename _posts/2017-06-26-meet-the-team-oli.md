## What does your typical office-day look like?
My days are quite varied. I have a few ongoing jobs, like managing our content calendar to ensure we’re regularly publishing insightful blog articles, and I usually speak with an external agency every couple of days to manage our PR activity. I generally spend some time looking at our performance each day - it’s not necessary to look so often, but I like to be as aware as possible. The rest of my time is spent working on shorter-term projects.
 
## What’s your favourite part of your job?
As my role is pretty broad I go through phases of focusing on different areas of marketing and communications. For example, I spent the last couple of months working on our [Mortgage Saver Review](https://trus.sl/MortgageSaverReview) - an industry-first report looking at mortgage accessibility and lending. Seeing it come to fruition was really rewarding. It’s been great to see the traction it’s gained in the national press and it’s encouraging to learn that lenders and large organisations have not only seen it, but are taking our research seriously. We’re in the process of creating some real value with this report that will become something tangible and benefit millions of people.
 
## Did you always think you’d work in marketing?
Not at all! I fell into marketing after studying music technology at university. My first job was at a record label and after spending a few weeks interning across several departments, I eventually landed in their marketing team. I really enjoyed it and have stuck with it since.
 
## What’s the best thing about Trussle?
I’m pleased to have had the opportunity to join Trussle during its early days and see the team and company grow during the last couple of years. It’s often been challenging but it’s been great to see everyone work hard and overcome the challenges together - it feels very much like a family. It’s also hugely motivating to have such a clear vision that has the potential to benefit millions of people.
 
## What’s the most challenging part of your job?
My role is fairly broad, and as I don’t have a deep knowledge of every area I’m often having to learn quickly. The variety means I’m constantly doing new things which is as exciting as it is challenging.
 
## Is there another startup that you think could do big things?
I’ve been following [POD Point](https://pod-point.com/) - an electric car charging infrastructure company - for the last couple of years (disclaimer: I participated in their crowdfunding campaign). I walk past one of their charging points on my way to work each day and keep note of how often they’re in use - probably around 30% of the time, for anyone who’s interested!
 
## Do you have any hidden talents?
Bit of a strange one, perhaps... but I’ve been writing a political manifesto over the last year or so, ready for when I venture into politics one day!
 
## Piece of marketing you really admire?
Transport For London (TFL) have fantastic messaging. It’s clear and simple, often witty and smart. Their visual style is really clean too. I’m proud in a way that my city’s transportation system has become so iconic!
 
## How do you spend your spare time?
I play piano. I don’t play anything in particular but I go through phases of varying styles which makes improvising fun.
 
## What was your first job? 
I joined Ministry of Sound fresh from university. I started out as an intern, working in the club’s cloakroom in the evenings for a bit of cash. Sometimes I’d work an entire day in the office, then work in the cloakroom until the early hours of the morning.
 
## Favourite book?
[Brave New World](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World) by Aldous Huxley.
