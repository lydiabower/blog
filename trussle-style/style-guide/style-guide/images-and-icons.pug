h4#image-photography Photography

p The Trussle photography style is candid, natural and should always feel like itâ€™s telling the story of a real person, not staged stock photography. We use photography to talk about real people, mostly when referring to real customers, the team or the culture.

p It should have a focus on space (rooms, skyline) and ownership (doors, DIY), on the excitiment and capturing the moment of getting a new home (moving in, Arranging the first ornaments, DIY, etc.).

h4#image-iconography Iconography

p Within the product, icons are very functinal and help users understand the information they are viewing. For these purposes we use a simple line icon in Trussle Green with a line weight of 2px. Icons are linear and should have enough straight corners to reflect the logo marque.

p At other times icons have a slightly different job. This is where illustration and iconography meet. We can use our illustration style to create icons in places that need to inspire, persuade or entertain users.
